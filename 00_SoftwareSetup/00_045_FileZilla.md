# 00.045 FileZilla

I do not recommend FileZilla for Windows, even if it is downloaded from the original source.  Even the original now appears to have malware, although it is currently rather limited malware.

If you use Linux or a Mac it is probably safe to install FileZilla, but only if you load it from your distribution's default repository.  Do not download and install from the FileZilla website, and do not use a private repository as a source for FileZilla.
