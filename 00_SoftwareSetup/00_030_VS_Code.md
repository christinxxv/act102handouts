## Text Editor

In this course, and in most technology fields, we need a *text editor.*  A text editor is different than a word processor like Word or Google Docs.  Word processors allow you to do things like format text for bold, insert images, and make clickable links.  Text editors just hold plain old letters.  The files themselves can't have any formatting other than carriage returns at the end of lines.

The program Notepad is a text editor that comes for free with Windows.
