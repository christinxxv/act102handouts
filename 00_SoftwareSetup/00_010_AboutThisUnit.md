# 00.010 About This Unit

This unit is mainly about getting your home computer set up.  I will go over most of these topics later, but sometimes people need to find the "how to" videos.  So I am putting them in one spot.

This unit is here for reference.  I will not put Unit 00 on an exam.  However, you may want to look here as the semester goes on to remind yourself how to set up your system.

It is also OK to go through this unit before the first day of class.

## And assumption

I am assuming that most people in this class are somewhat computer literate.  Therefore I assume that most people can do things like follow a link to a url, install a file, and open Windows Explorer.

But I also realize that everyone has some gaps in their knowledge.  So please don't be afraid to ask if I seem to be assuming that you know something and you don't.  To a large extent, this Unit00 is based on things I have discovered that some people need review over.  I also ask the more advanced users to be patient and to offer assistance to class members who may not be as advanced as they are on some topics.

## What is *nix

The term *nix is often used to indicate "Any unix-like operating system."  

Both Mac the Macintosh Operating System and the Linux Operating System use versions of the Unix operating system.  Chromebooks use a form of Linux as well. So in this course *nix indicates the instructions are for either Mac users, Linux users, or adventurous Chromebook users.  

# Chromebooks

Newer, fully updated Chromebooks should, in theory, work for this course.  However, this is a fairly new development.  For right now I do not encourage or support the use of Chromebooks in this course.  However, if more advanced and adventurous students wish to use Chromebooks I will try to help.  But be warned that not everything will work as described in class.

## Table of Contents for this unit

* [How to make Windows 10 show file extensions](https://github.com/noynaert/act102handouts/blob/master/00_SoftwareSetup/00_020_Windows_Setup.md) *Only for Windows users* This unit talks about file names and extensions.  At the end there is a description about how to change Windows 10 so that file extensions are shown.
* [Setting up VS Code](https://github.com/noynaert/act102handouts/blob/master/00_SoftwareSetup/00_030_VS_Code.md) *Windows and *nix users*  VS Code is the main editor we will use this semester.  This video shows two important things:
  * How to use the VS Code interface
  * What extensions you will need for this course
* [Bitvise for SFTP](https://github.com/noynaert/act102handouts/blob/master/00_SoftwareSetup/00_040_Bitvise_for_SFTP.md) *Windows Only*
* [FileZilla for SFTP](https://github.com/noynaert/act102handouts/blob/master/00_SoftwareSetup/00_045_FileZilla.md) *\*nix users and maybe Windows users* FileZilla is an alternative to Bitvise.  However, it does have some dangers, especially for Windows users.  It is a safer option for *nix users.
* [Setting up VS Code for SFTP](https://github.com/noynaert/act102handouts/blob/master/00_SoftwareSetup/00_050_SFTP_in_VS_Code.md) *Windows and *nix users* Bitvise will get you through this course.  But you may prefer to use VS Code directly.
