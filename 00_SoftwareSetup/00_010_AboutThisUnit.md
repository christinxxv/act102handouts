# 00.010 About This Unit

This unit is mainly about getting your home computer set up.  I will go over most of these topics later, but sometimes people need to find the "how to" videos.  So I am putting them in one spot.

This unit is here for reference.  I will not put Unit 00 on an exam.  However, you may want to look here as the semester goes on to remind yourself how to set up your system.

It is also OK to go through this unit before the first day of class.
