# 00.010 About This Unit

This unit is mainly about getting your home computer set up.  I will go over most of these topics later, but sometimes people need to find the "how to" videos.  So I am putting them in one spot.

This unit is here for reference.  I will not put Unit 00 on an exam.  However, you may want to look here as the semester goes on to remind yourself how to set up your system.

It is also OK to go through this unit before the first day of class.

## What is *nix

The term *nix is often used to indicate "Any unix-like operating system."  

Both Mac the Macintosh Operating System and the Linux Operating System use versions of the Unix operating system.  Chromebooks use a form of Linux as well. So in this course *nix indicates the instructions are for either Mac users, Linux users, or adventurous Chromebook users.  

# Chromebooks

Newer, fully updated Chromebooks should, in theory, work for this course.  However, this is a fairly new development.  For right now I do not encourage or support the use of Chromebooks in this course.  However, if more advanced and adventurous students wish to use Chromebooks I will try to help.  But be warned that not everything will work as described in class.

  * How to use the VS Code interface
  * What extensions you will need for this course
