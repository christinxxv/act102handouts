## 404 -- Page not found

For the Spring 2020 semester I decided to move this page until after the 1st exam.  For at least Spring 2020 it will be on the second exam.

[Here is some slightly more information about 404 errors](https://blog.thomasnet.com/industrial-website-404-error).

Meanwhile, [here are some 404 pages you may enjoy](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33766/10-clever-website-error-messages-from-creative-companies.aspx).

Also, please note that this page is not technically a 404 error.  The file you were looking for *was* found, so it was not really a 404 error.
