# Shortcuts and Helpers

There are certain keystrokes and shortcuts I expect people to use.  These are not just time-savers.  Some of them, like Control-a prevent you from making errors.

## Macs

These are presented for Windows and Linux users.  Most of them work for a Mac as well if you make the necessary adjustments for lack of a Control key and a right mouse button.  Here is a page on Mac keyboard shortcuts.

I have noticed that some Macs have the shortcut keys switched around a bit in the settings for "Keyboard Preferences."  If things are not working as expected you might want to check there.

On the exam there may be shortcuts for Windows/Linux system.  You should know the standard shortcuts, even if you are a Mac user.
