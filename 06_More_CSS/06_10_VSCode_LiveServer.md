# 06 10 -- Live Server and Other VS Code Extensions


## LiveServer

Load Live Server by Ritwick Dey in VS Code extensions

- Right click on the .html file and select the Live Server option.
127.0.0.1 is a "Loopback Address."  
- It is an IPv4 address  Loopback addresses refer back to your local computer
- Make sure you have Chrome or Firefox installed and have it set as your default browser
- Browsers that will not work well in all cases:
  - Safari
  - Internet Explorer
- Browsers that probably work, but I have not tested them:
  - Chromium
  - Edge
  - Brave
- Note that the web page is running on your local computer, so you cannot address it by address on the validator site.

Pirate Ipsum is fun.  But it doesn't work on all systems.
