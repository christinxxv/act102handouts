            <h3>Gates Barbecue</h3>
            <p>The Gates saga began in 1946 when George W. Gates decided that a family-owned and operated restaurant would be more enticing than life with the railroad. He pooled his resources and opened “Gates Ol’ Kentucky” at 19th and Vine which was the first of the now thriving restaurant chain known today as “Gates Bar-B-Q.”</p>
