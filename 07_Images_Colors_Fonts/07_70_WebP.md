# 07.70 WebP format

WebP is is a fairly new format for images.

## Reference

[https://developers.google.com/speed/webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)

## Both lossy and lossless versions

* The lossy version has smaller files than .jpg
* The lossless version has smaller files than .png

## Image editing software 

Not all image editing software can handle webp, but the situation is improving.

I have found GIMP to be the most reliable

## Using webp

Most browsers handle webp well, but things like zoom don't recognize the format.
