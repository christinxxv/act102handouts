\question Suppose the page you are working on has a tag that looks like this: \texttt{<div id="geography"}.  Write a link to go to the geography id for a link on the same page. 
\vspace{1cm}

\question Can the id attribute go in tags other than <div> tags?  Can you still link to an id that is not in a div tag?  You may need to experiment to figure it out; I don't think it is in the notes or video.

Would it be better to use an absolute or relative address when you link to the cuisine.html file?  Defend you answer.
