\question Suppose the page you are working on has a tag that looks like this: \texttt{<div id="geography"}.  Write a link to go to the geography id for a link on the same page. 
\vspace{1cm}

\question Can the id attribute go in tags other than <div> tags?  Can you still link to an id that is not in a div tag?  You may need to experiment to figure it out; I don't think it is in the notes or video.

\vspace{10mm}

\question Think about the homework you are doing for your geographic area.  You want to add a page called "cuisine.html" 
that discusses the food styles of your area.  You then want to link to cuisine.html from your main page.  Assume you are working away from school (say, on an airplane with no internet access) with the files on your local computer.  You will upload them to the webservices server later. 
Would it be better to use an absolute or relative address when you link to the cuisine.html file?  Defend you answer.
\vspace{15mm}

\question Let's assume the same situation as the question above.  You want to link from your cuisine.html page to another page about the style of food in your area.  Would you use an absolute or relative address in the link? \\blank\blank
