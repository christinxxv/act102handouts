# Exam 01

The exam will be on the following date:

* Friday, February 7, 2020

The exam will cover Units 01, 02, and 03.  We have not yet covered https://github.com/noynaert/ACT102_Notes/blob/master/01_Structure_and_Servers/01B_Servers.md, but we will do so in class.

The notes for 03B_Uploading will not be on the exam.  However, the ability to upload files is something you will need to be able to do for this course.

**Everyone must physically come to class on the exam day; no one may take the exam remotely.**
ADA requirements will be respected.

The exam will be based primarily on the Github notes.  Also be sure to look at the text and W3Schools links in the notes

Be sure you can write an entire web page "by hand" without using the assists from VS Code.I will give you the &lt;meta char-set="utf-8"> statement, but you must know where to place it.

The exam will be on paper.  You will need a #2 pencil and eraser.  Mechanical pencils do not work well.  I will bring a supply of pencils.

The exam will be closed book, closed notes.
