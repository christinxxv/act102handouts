The exam will be on the following dates:

* Wednesday, November 20 (Evening Section)
* Thursday, November 21 (Day Section)

**Everyone must physically come to class on the exam day; no one may take the exam remotely.**

The exam will be based primarily on the Github notes.  Also be sure to look at the text and W3Schools links in the notes

The exam will have fewer multiple choice questions and more code writing.

* You should be able to write a complete table including &lt;thead> and &lt;tbody>
* Complete forms.  This may include the input types listed in the notes on github as well as the attributes like ```required``` and ```pattern```.

The exam will cover 09_Tables, 10_Forms, and 11_More_Form_Controls from the github notes.

There are a lot of forms with different syntax.  Therefore I am going to allow everyone to bring a 4x6 or 3x5 note card as a cheatsheet.

* I will pass out 4x6 notecards in class.
* Notecards must be *hand written.*  You may not type or print off the notecard.  You must prepare your own notecard in your own writing.  You may work with other students to prepare the notecard, but you must write your own by hand.  There are two reasons for the hand-written notecards
  * I don't want one student to mass produce cards for several people
  * There is learning value in writing out the notecards.  
  * The small size and the handwritten requirement forces you to prioritize what goes on the card.  Prioritizing the important points is an important part of test preparation.
