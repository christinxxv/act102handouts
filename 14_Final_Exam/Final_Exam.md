## Finals and Course Grade

According to the course syllabus, the final exam may be counted in two different ways.  The version that gives you the best grade for the course will be used.

Your lowest exam score will be dropped.

* The final exam may be counted as a regular exam.  This will happen if your final exam is lower than any other text score.
* The final exam may be counted as two regular exams.  This will happen if your final exam is a higher grade than one or more of your other exams.  

### How the final will work mechanically

There are 4 exams in the course including the final.  However the Canvas gradebook will show 5 exams.  It will show 5 exams because the final exam will be entered twice.  Then the lowest of the 5 scores will be dropped and the other 4 tests will be used to calculate your score.
