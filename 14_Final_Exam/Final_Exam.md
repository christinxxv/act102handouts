# Final Exam

The exam will be based on the handouts, notes, and videos.

The final will cover the last unit and also will have a comprehensive component.

The final may count in one of two ways.  I will use the method that gives you the highest grade.

In the gradebook the final exam grade will be entered two times.  There will appear to be 4 exams.  I will drop your lowest exam grade.  This means if you have an exam grade that is lower than your final exam, the lower grade will be dropped and the final exam will count twice.  However, if your lowest grade is on the final exam, then the final exam only counts as a regular exam and does not get counted twice.
