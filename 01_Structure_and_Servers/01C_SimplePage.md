The internet hosts two types of computers -- Clients and Servers.

## Addresses

Every computer (both clients and servers) on the internet must have an address.  Internet addresses take two forms.  The older form is known as IPv4.  The newer addresses are IPv6. Here are some examples

### Examples of older IPv4 addresses

* 150.200.1.1
* 192.168.1.1
* 127.0.0.1

### Examples of newer IPv6 addresses

* FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329
* FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329
* fe00::0

## Clients

Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Safari are clients.  Clients usually only run when a human user wants to pull something off the Internet (or forgets and leaves their computer on).

## Servers

Servers typically run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They sit and wait for a client to contact them and request information.

Servers often do not have keyboards or monitors permanently attached.  They often reside in data centers.

Servers have numerical addresses.  But servers often have "URL" addresses as well.  These look like http://missouriwestern.edu or http://turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu.

## Servers on our campus

We actually have a lot of servers on our campus.

### Mini-exercise

* Visit http://turing.cs.missouriwestern.edu/
* Hold down the Ctrl key and press "u".  (On Windows or Linux, not sure about a Mac)
* You should now see the "source code" for the page.  
  * You should understand what most of the tags are.
  * What is the title of the page?  Does the title show up anywhere?  If so, where?
  * Does the page have any header tags?
  * What would you guess the &lt;style&gt; tag does?
  * Is the style in the head or body of the document?
  * Inside the style tag there is some CSS.  
    * We will cover CSS in a few weeks.  
    * CSS is concerned with the appearance of the document.  HTML is concerned with the structure.

## The P: drive

The P: drive is a drive on campus computers.  The P: drive is only available on campus.  There are ways to get to it from off campus, but they are harder than on campus.  This is why I suggest doing the first couple of assignments from on campus.  I will show you how to get to it in a couple of weeks when you will not be so overwhelmed by other things in the class.  Also, I hope you will have developed a higher threshold for frustration by that point. :smirk:

Your P: drive should have a directory called P:\public_html.
