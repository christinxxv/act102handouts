# JavaScript 050 -- About JavaScript

* JavaScript (or JS) is a programming language
* It is not the same thing as Java.  Java and JavaScript are entirely different languages
* In many ways JavaScript is an extention of html.  Sometimes it is hard to tell where html stops and JS starts
* Technically, JavaScript is known as ECMAscript.
  * Currently we are on ES6
  * Don't use any tutorials from before 2016 because they may refer to old versions of ES6
* There is a system called node.js that allows programming at the command line as well as in the browser

## The Console

When writing JavaScript always open a browser's "Inspect" window and select "Console"

This will show you syntax errors.  It is also useful for sending debugging and status informatoin.
