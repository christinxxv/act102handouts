## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a framework for CSS.

* *"Responsive"* "Responsive" means it works and adapts across different screen sizes.  It has a "Mobile First" philosophy
* It provides pre-built components people use in CSS such as nav-bars and buttons
* It "fixes" a lot of the annoyances of CSS
* It provides a lot of nice features like grid layout and containers
* Mostly it is a lot of classes

## Versions of Bootstrap

This material is based on Bootstrap version 5.  At the time I am writing this, Version 5 is a late-stage beta Version.

### Major Changes in Version 5

* No more jQuery
* More responsive containers and grids
* More scalable fonts
* Allowing for .svg files

## How to include bootstrap

### Download method

* Development
* Minified

#### About minified code

Minified code squeezes out blank spaces, comments, and unnecessary code.  

### CDN Method

**Content Delivery Network**

A CDN is a server that distributes standardized software

* Conserves Bandwidth: Your website does not have to download specialized software
* Better Load Speed: The software package probably downloads faster because there are usually CDNs located all over the world
* Even faster load speed:  Your page may not even need to download the software if it is already in cache

#### CDNs do have downsides

* Danger of code injection, but this is greatly minimized by the "integrity" field
* May load more software than needed
* General (personal) insecurity from lack of complete control
