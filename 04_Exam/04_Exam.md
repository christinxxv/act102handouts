# Exam 01

The exam will be on the following dates:

* Wednesday, Septemner 18 (Evening Section)
* Thursday September 19 (Day Section)

**Everyone must physically come to class on the exam day; no one may take the exam remotely.**

The exam will be based primarily on the Github notes.  Also be sure to look at the text and W3Schools links in the notes

Be sure you can write an entire web page "by hand" without using the assists from VS Code.I will give you the &lt;meta char-set="utf-8"> statement, but you must know where to place it.

I currently plan to do a paper exam, but it may turn out to be an exam in Canvas.  It is also possible it will be a two-part exam, with some in canvas and some written on paper.

The exam will be closed book, closed notes.
