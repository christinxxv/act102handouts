# 01B Servers

The internet hosts two types of computers -- Clients and Servers.

## Clients

Browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Safari are clients.  Clients usually only run when a human user wants to pull something off the Internet (or forgets and leaves their computer on).

## Servers

Servers typically run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They sit and wait for a client to contact them and request information.

Servers often do not have keyboards or monitors permanently attached.  They often reside in data centers.
